-- SQL Project Planning
-- You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date.
-- It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.
-- If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.
-- Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order.
-- If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.

-- print total number of unique hackers who made at least 1 submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest)
-- find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day.
-- If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id.
-- The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.
